Pokedex
A Pokédex is a digital encyclopedia in the Pokémon universe that provides detailed information about each Pokémon species. It includes data like a Pokémon’s name, type, height, weight, abilities, and evolutionary details. In games and shows, trainers use the Pokédex to track which Pokémon they’ve seen or caught, making it an essential tool for any Pokémon journey.
